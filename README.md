From the root of the site, click the link `My data` to trigger a page endpoint error. This error is caught and logged server-side by `handleError`. Because there's an error page, `__error.svelte`, that gets rendered.

When clicking the button `Get data`, an error is also triggered. This error is also caught server-side by `handleError`, however, it does not cause `__error.svelte` to be rendered, because it doesn't cause any navigations. (More specifically, because it does not fail during `loading` -- clicking the link _does_ trigger an error during `loading` -- it's just that the `load` function that sees the error is autogenerated because it's a page endpoint.)
